#Compiling and Running TherapistJen

To compile and run TherapistJen, one must first be either on the UBC Okanagan campus and connected to an official UBC network, or connected to myvpn.ok.ubc.ca. This will allow TherapistJen to access her database or responses. 

When running TherapistJen, first run the "TherapistJen.py" file and then follow the hyperlink address that is generated in the terminal. This will bring you to TherapistJens's chatroom.

Proceed to use TherapistJen to aid you in the maintenence of your mental health.




#Dependencies:
re, cherrypy, pyodbc, spacy, tensorflow, keras, numpy

#Components:
The functionality of the program is divided into four sections:

Web-based Platform Use - located in the "static" folder

Natural Language Processing - located in the "NLP" folder, this is used to process the user input into usable data.

Neural Network - based Machine Learning - located in the "NN+Support" folder, this is used to associate the useable data from the NLP with the feelings of the one writing the input

SQL Database Queries - located in the "JenDatabaseQueryTechniques.py" file, this is used to access the database of responses that TherapistJen has available.


#Classes:
parsingStringFunction.negativeThoughtsOrGoals(userMessage) - returns 'negative' or 'goals' as the user responds to TherapistJen.

parsingStringFunction.questionOrStatement(userMessage) - determines if the userMessage is a question or a statement and returns 'question' or 'statement'.

NLP_For_Training.main(userInput) - analyses the userInput and returns a matrix counting the presneces of each flagged word. Formatted for use as input for the Neural Network.

JenDatabaseQueryTechniques.getResponse(sOrQ, feeling, subject, questionNum) - uses input to query the SQL database for the appropriate response.

JenDatabaseQueryTechniques.searchStringFor(userMessage, synonym) - searches userMessage for synonym and returns true if the synonym is contained within userMessage. Return false otherwise.

JenDatabaseQueryTechniques.getFeeling(userMessage) - associates userMessage with a catagory of feeling. Returns string.

neural_net_response.getResponse(sOrQ,userInput, subject, questionNum) - uses input to query the SQL database for the appropriate response using the neural net
